# Lambda Calculus with JavaScript

This repository is dedicated to demonstrating the principles of lambda calculus using JavaScript. Lambda calculus is a formal system in mathematical logic for expressing computation based on function abstraction and application, forming the foundation for the theory of programming languages and functional programming. Below is a brief overview of the contents and the concepts demonstrated in the code.

## Overview

The code is a JavaScript representation of various fundamental concepts in the theory of computation, such as Turing Machines, Lambda Calculus, and the Church-Turing thesis.

### Turing Machines

The comments provide a succinct explanation of Turing Machines as a mathematical model of computation, capable of simulating any algorithm or machine, introduced by Alan Turing in 1936.

### Lambda Calculus

Lambda calculus is explained with its rules and grammar. Itâ€™s introduced as a way to express computations based on function abstraction and application, introduced by Alonzo Church in the 1930s.

### Church-Turing Thesis

A brief on the Church-Turing thesis is also provided, explaining it as a principle stating that any algorithm expressed in a mathematical model of computation, like a Turing machine, can also be expressed in lambda calculus.

## Code Explanation

The JavaScript code demonstrates various aspects of Lambda Calculus:

- **Basic Concepts**: Defining basic lambda calculus concepts like Identity Function, TRUE, and FALSE.
- **Logical Operations**: Implementing logical operations such as NOT, AND, and OR.
- **Numbers and Arithmetic Operations**: Definition and manipulation of numbers, and implementation of arithmetic operations like Successor, Predecessor, Summation, Subtraction, and Multiplication.
- **Comparison Operations**: Implementation of comparison operations like ISZERO, Less than or Equal (LEQ), More than or Equal (MEQ), and Equal (EQ).
- **Y Combinator and Division Operation**: An attempt to implement the Y combinator and a division function, demonstrating more advanced concepts in lambda calculus.

## Usage

You can run the JavaScript code in any JavaScript environment, like a web browser console or Node.js. The code includes console.log statements to output the results of various lambda calculus operations, helping understand the execution and the results of the lambda calculus expressions and functions defined.
